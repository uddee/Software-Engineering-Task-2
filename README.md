# Higher/Lower Card Game

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of a **Higher/Lower Card Game**, where players guess if the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current one. The project demonstrates Python programming fundamentals and interactive game design.

## Features
- **Deck Management**: A shuffled 52-card deck.
- **Game Logic**: CLI-based gameplay with real-time feedback.
- **GUI (Optional)**: Built using Tkinter for an interactive experience.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps the playerâ€™s score throughout the session.

## How to Run
1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
   - Install any additional libraries (`tkinter` is standard in most Python distributions).

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells sequentially.
   - Play the CLI version or try the GUI (if included).

## Future Enhancements
- Add graphical card representations in the GUI.
- Introduce leaderboards and player statistics.
- Allow multiplayer modes with shared scoring.
